## 1.3 The Certified Tester Expert Level in Software Testing

The Expert Level qualification is aimed at those who have already achieved an advanced point in their careers in software testing and wish to develop further their expertise in a specific area. The modules offered at the Expert Level cover a wide range of testing topics.

A testing expert is one who has a broad knowledge of testing in general, and an in depth understanding in a special test area. An in-depth understanding is defined as having sufficient knowledge of testing theory and practice to be able to influence the direction that an organization and/or project takes when creating, implementing and executing testing processes.

To participate in the Expert Level exam in the module “Improving the Testing Process”, candidates must hold the Advanced Level certificate in test management.

In addition to passing the exam, proof needs to be provided of practical working experience in the testing field in general and specifically in the field represented by the Expert Level module before the Expert Level certificate is awarded. In addition to passing the exam the following requirements apply:

- at least five years of practical testing experience (CV needs to be submitted including two references)

- at least two years of experience in the Expert Level module topic (CV needs to be submitted including two references)

- at least one paper written and published, OR a presentation is given at a testing conference covering an Expert Level module topic.

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of improving the test process; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in an accredited Expert Level training course.

## 1.6 How this Syllabus is Organized

There are ten major chapters. The top level heading shows the time for the chapter. For example:

2. The Context of Improvement

180 mins.

shows that Chapter 2 is intended to have a time of 180 minutes for teaching the material in the chapter. Specific learning objectives are listed at the start of each chapter.

## 1.7 Terms and Definitions

Many terms used in the software literature are used interchangeably. The definitions in this Expert Level Syllabus are available in the Standard Glossary of Terms Used in Software Testing, published by the ISTQB [ISTQB-Glossary].

Each of the keywords listed at the start of each chapter in this Expert Level Syllabus is defined in [ISTQB-Glossary].

## 1.8 Learning Objectives (LO) / Levels of Knowledge (K)

The following learning objective definitions apply to this syllabus. Each topic in the syllabus will be examined according to the learning objective assigned to it.

## **Level 1:  Remember (K1)**

The candidate will recognize, remember and recall a term or concept.

Keywords: Remember, recall, recognize, know

## Example

Can recognize the definition of “failure” as:

- “non-delivery of service to an end user or any other stakeholder” or

- “actual deviation of the component or system from its expected delivery, service or result”.

## **Level 2:  Understand (K2)**

The candidate can select the reasons or explanations for statements related to the topic, and can summarize, differentiate, classify and give examples for facts (e.g., compare terms), testing concepts and test procedures (explaining the sequence of tasks).

Keywords: Summarize, classify, compare, map, contrast, exemplify, interpret, translate, represent, infer, conclude, categorize

Examples

Explain the reason why tests should be designed as early as possible:

- To find defects when they are cheaper to remove

- To find the most important defects first

Explain the similarities and differences between integration and system testing:

- Similarities: testing more than one component, and can test non-functional aspects

- Differences: integration testing concentrates on interfaces and interactions whereas system testing concentrates on whole-system aspects, such as end to end processing

## **Level 3:  Apply (K3)**

The candidate can select the correct application of a concept or technique and apply it to a given context. K3 is normally applicable to procedural knowledge. There is no creative act involved such as

evaluating a software application or creating a model for a given software. When we have a given model and cover the procedural steps to create test cases from the model in the syllabus, then it is K3.

Keywords: Implement, execute, use, follow a procedure, apply a procedure Example

- Can identify boundary values for valid and invalid partitions.

- Use the generic procedure for test case creation to derive the test cases from a given state transition diagram in order to cover all transitions.

## **Level 4:  Analyze (K4)**

The candidate can separate information related to a procedure or technique into its constituent parts for better understanding, and can distinguish between facts and inferences. Typical application is to analyze a document, software or a project situation and propose appropriate actions to solve a problem or accomplish a task.

Keywords: Analyze, differentiate, select, structure, focus, attribute, deconstruct, evaluate, judge, monitor, coordinate, create, synthesize, generate, hypothesize, plan, design, construct, produce Example

- Analyze product risks and propose preventive and corrective mitigation activities.

- Describe which portions of an incident report are factual and which are inferred from results.

## **Level 5:  Evaluate (K5)**

The candidate may make judgments based on criteria and standards. He detects inconsistencies or fallacies within a process or product, determines whether a process or product has internal consistency and detects the effectiveness of a procedure as it is being implemented (e.g., determine if a scientist's conclusions follow from observed data.)

Keywords: Evaluate, coordinate, detect, monitor. judge, critique

Example

- Judge whether a specific review process has been effectively and efficiently applied in a given situation.

- Evaluate the test results and problem reports and propose a recommendation to the stakeholder whether further testing is required.

- Evaluate whether a given set of test cases has achieved a coverage level.

- Monitor the risk mitigation activities, propose improvements (includes summarizing results).

## **Level 6:  Create (K6)**

The candidate puts elements together to form a coherent or functional whole. Typical application is to reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure, devise a procedure for accomplishing some task, or invent a product (e.g., build habitats for a specific purpose).

Keywords: Generate, hypothesize, plan, design, construct, produce Example

- Generate an appropriate risk management process that includes both rigorous and informal elements.

- Create the test approach for a project that considers the context of the company's policy, project / product, test objectives, risks and timeline to form a dynamic strategy to balance an analytical strategy.

- Construct a review process from the elements of different review types to form an effective process for the organization.

Refer to [Anderson] for details about the cognitive levels of learning objectives.

## 1.9 Expectations

The Learning Objectives in this syllabus are intended to develop participants to fulfill the following expectations:

## 2.1 Why Improve Testing?

Systems in which software is a dominant factor are becoming more and more challenging to build. They are playing an increasingly important role in society. New methods, techniques, and tools are becoming available to support development and maintenance tasks. Because software plays such an

Page 13 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

important role in our lives both economically and socially, there is pressure for the software engineering discipline to focus on quality issues. Poor quality software is no longer acceptable to society. Software failures can result in huge business losses or even become catastrophic, e.g., loss of human lives.

Improving the test process should take place within the context of:

- Current business and organizational challenges

- The maintenance challenges of currently delivered systems

- Current testing and quality assurance challenges

In this context the importance of the testing discipline, as one of the quality measures that can be taken, is growing rapidly. Often projects spend substantial parts of their budget on testing.

Organizations face tougher business objectives every day such as decreased time-to-market, higher quality and reliability and reduced costs. We develop and manufacture many products where the majority of the development costs relate to software. At the same time, options are now available for software development to be outsourced or co-developed with other sites. Together with the trend towards more re-use and platform architecture, integration and testing are becoming key activities that directly influence not only the product quality but also the effective and efficient conduct of the entire development and manufacturing process. Testers may be working on software products, or on products with a mix of software and hardware, or products including a mix of software with other products in many different media.

Software is increasing in importance and size. The amount of software in consumer products roughly doubles every 24 months as does the complexity in professional applications.  The complexity of the software directly influences the number of defects per „”unit” of software (e.g., Function Points). As the market is demanding better and more reliable products that are developed and produced in less time with a reduced amount of money, higher testing effectiveness and efficiency is no longer an option; it is an essential ingredient for success.

Delivered systems include other products and services as well as software code. The system may also include hardware, middleware and firmware. In some circumstances, the delivered service might include new buildings, changes to working practices and new infrastructure.  As a result, testing may extend to dress rehearsals of the transition and into the first days for the full working organization in its new premises.

The scope of testing is not necessarily limited to the software system. Further, the people buying and using software don‟t just need the code, they also need services and products such as business processes, training, user guides and support. The improvement of testing must be carried out in the context of the wider quality goals – whether these are the goals of an organization, one or more customer organizations or one or more IT groups/teams.

The context within which test process improvement takes place includes any business/organizational process improvement and any IT or software process improvement.

Typical reasons for business improvements which influence testing are:

- A business has a testing service that provides a high quality engineering approach which takes too long.  If the goal is to reduce time to market but high quality must be maintained, then test improvement efforts may be focused on:

- Cutting the time for testing by increased efficiency without reducing effectiveness Increasing earlier testing activities (e.g. static testing) in order to reduce time taken to resolve defects later in the lifecycle

- The need to increase the quality of deliverables when the increased time and cost of testing may be a reasonable price for improved quality

- The desire to increase the ability of testers to provide predictability and better reporting.

- The requirement for organizations that provide third party support to meet client requirements for their suppliers to be at a particular capability level,

Page 14 of 75

- The need to save money by cutting the cost of testing

- The desire to reduce overall project throughput time by integrating testing within the software development process

- The desire to reduce the costs of failure by improving testing

- The need to show compliance to applicable standards (Section 2.5.4.5)

Test process improvement may take place within the context of organizational and business improvement. This may, for example, be managed via one of the following:

- Total Quality Management (TQM)

- ISO 9000:2000

- An excellence framework such as the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model™ or its equivalent

- Six Sigma

Test process improvement may take place in the context of IT/software process improvement. This may be managed via one of the following:

- Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI®) (Section 3.2.1).

- ISO/IEC 15504 (Section 3.2.2)

- ITIL® [ITIL], [ITIL2]

- Team Software Process (TSP)[SM] and Personal Software Process (PSP)[SM] [Humphrey]

## 2.2 What can be Improved?

Software Process Improvement (SPI) is the continuous improvement of product quality, process effectiveness and process efficiency leading to improved quality of the software product.

Test improvement is the continuous improvement of the effectiveness and/or the efficiency of the testing process within the context of the overall software process. This context means that improvements to testing may go beyond just the process itself, for example extending to the infrastructure, organization and testers‟ skills. Also, test process improvements may indicate that associated or complementary improvements are needed to requirements management and other parts of the development process. Conversely, test process improvements may be driven by overall SPI efforts.

Testing goals must always be aligned to business goals. It is not always optimal for an organization or project to achieve the maximum levels of test maturity.

## 2.3 Views of Quality

In a single project we may use several definitions of quality, perhaps inadvertently and unacknowledged by all the people in the project. It is important to realize that there is no “right” definition of quality. Improvement of the test process should consider which of the quality views discussed in this section are most applicable to the organization.

Five views of software quality are explained with examples in [Trienekens and van Veenendaal 97], which is based on [Garvin Paper 84]. The five views are:

- Product

- Manufacturing

- User

- Value

- Transcendent

In terms of the types, levels and techniques that may be used through the test process, the quality viewpoints may be addressed during static and dynamic test activities by using roles and representative viewpoints [see example in Evans04].

Page 15 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

How we define “quality” for a particular product, service or project depends on context. Different industries will have different quality views. Safety critical products will require an emphasis on the product and manufacturing definitions of quality. Entertainment and game products will require the user definition and may also require product attributes not normally considered in other industries – for example "Excitement" as part of Usability. Software being launched as an innovative new product requires the value-based definition because if we spend more time to get a better product we may miss the market window. For most commercial or custom software, the customer is best served by balancing the quality aspects. For these products, we should ask ourselves: What is the greatest number or level of attributes (product-based) that we can deliver to support the users‟ tasks (userbased) while giving best cost-benefit (value-based) while following repeatable, quality-assured processes within a managed project (manufacturing-based)?

The metrics that could be associated with these quality views are discussed in Chapter 4, Analytical Methods and Chapter 6, Process for Improvement.

## 2.4 The Generic Improvement Process

## _2.4.1 The Deming Cycle_

Continuous improvement involves setting improvement objectives, taking measures to achieve them and, once they have been achieved, setting new improvement objectives. Continuous Improvement Models have been established to support this concept.

The Deming-Cycle is a useful generic framework for achieving continuous improvement and consists

of the following steps:

- **Plan:** targets are defined for quality characteristics, costs and service levels. The targets may initially be formulated by management as business improvement goals and successively broken down into individual “control points” which should be checked (see below) to see that the activities have been carried out. Defined objectives should be measurable (for further information, refer to Section 4.4). An analysis of current practices and skills is performed after which improvement plans are set up for improving the test process.

- **Do:** After the plans have been made, the activities are performed. Included in this step is an investment in human resources (e.g., training and coaching).

- **Check:** The control points identified in the planning step are tracked using specific metrics, and deviations are observed. The variations in each metric may be predicted for a specific time interval and compared with the actual observations to provide information on deviations between the actual and expected.

- **Act** (sometimes referred to as “Analyze/Act”): Using the information gathered, opportunities for performance increase are identified and prioritized.

In the first two steps (“Plan” and “Do”) the sense of what is important plays the central role. In the last two steps (“Check” and “Act”) statistical methods and systems analysis techniques are most often used to help pinpoint statistical significance, dependencies and further areas for improvement.

## _2.4.2 The IDEAL improvement framework_

The IDEAL framework [IDEAL 96] is an instantiation of the Deming-Cycle mentioned above. It provides a process improvement framework covering the following stages and sub-stages that can be applied when improving the testing process.

## _2.4.3 Fundamental Concepts of Excellence_

The Fundamental Concepts of Excellence are used in organizational excellence models globally to measure organizations against the eight criteria which are listed below. The European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) provides an example [EFQM-Web], and the reference section of this syllabus provides pointers to equivalent models used outside Europe.

The Fundamental Concepts of Excellence, (as described at [EFQM-Web]), are:

- **Results Orientation:** “Excellence is dependent upon balancing and satisfying the needs of all relevant stakeholders (this includes the people employed, customers, suppliers and society in general as well as those with financial interests in the organization).”

- **Customer Focus:** “The customer is the final arbiter of product and service quality and customer loyalty, retention and market share gain are best optimized through a clear focus on the needs of current and potential customers.”

- **Leadership & Constancy of Purpose:** “The behavior of an organization‟s leaders creates a clarity and unity of purpose within the organization and an environment in which the organization and its people can excel.”

- **Management by Processes & Facts:** “Organizations perform more effectively when all interrelated activities are understood and systematically managed and decisions concerning current operations are planned. Improvements are made using reliable information that includes stakeholder perceptions.”

- **People Development & Involvement** : “The full potential of an organization‟s people is best released through shared values and a culture of trust and empowerment, which encourages the involvement of everyone.”

- **Continuous Learning, Innovation & Improvement:** “Organizational performance is maximized when it is based on the management and sharing of knowledge within a culture of continuous learning, innovation and improvement.”

- **Partnership Development:** “An organization works more effectively when it has mutually beneficial relationships, built on trust, sharing of knowledge and integration with its Partners.”

- **Corporate Social Responsibility:** “The long-term interest of the organization and its people are best served by adopting an ethical approach and exceeding the expectations and regulations of the community at large.”

Other organizational quality and excellence initiatives, such as Six Sigma and Balanced Score Card also provide a way of discussing the goals for an organization, deciding how to achieve those goals, and measuring whether they have been achieved.

## 2.5 Overview of Improvement Approaches

## _2.5.1 Overview of Model-based Approaches_

To improve product quality, the software industry has focused on improving their development processes. A guideline that has been widely used to improve the development processes is the Capability Maturity Model. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM®) , its successor the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), and ISO/IEC 15504 are often regarded as the industry standard for system and software process improvement.

Despite the fact that testing can account for substantial parts of project costs, only limited attention is given to testing in the various software process improvement models such as the CMMI. As an answer, the testing community has created complementary improvement models.

The ISTQB Advanced syllabus identifies test process improvement as one of the key areas within the testing profession and identifies two principal model-based approaches:

- Process models define generic bodies of testing best practice and how to improve different aspects of testing in a prescribed step-by-step manner. Examples are the Test Process Improvement (TPI Next®) model and the Test Maturity Model integrated (TMMi®). Both are described in Section 3.3. Other less used models are mentioned in the ISTQB Advanced syllabus.

- Content models are non-prescriptive; they do not require that improvements occur in a specific order. Instead, they define specific activities which can benefit a test process if applied well. The Systematic Test and Evaluation Process (STEP) and the Critical Testing Process (CTP) are two principal examples of this approach. Both are described in Section 3.4.

## _2.5.2 Overview of Analytical Approaches_

Analytical approaches typically involve the analysis of specific measures and metrics in order to assess the current situation in a test process, decide on what improvement steps to take and how to measure their impact. The Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach is a typical example of an analytical approach and is covered in Section 4.3.

Chapter 4 covers analytical approaches in more detail.

## _2.5.3 Hybrid Approaches_

A hybrid approach can be applied in which projects which have already been developed to a higher level of process maturity, (using either model-based approaches, analytical approaches or a mix of both), are used to set and measure improvement goals for other projects. This is a common sense approach which ensures that practices that work within a particular organization can be transferred to other similar projects without needing to rely entirely on the predefined best practices of a standard process model (see Section 3.3).

## _2.5.4 Other Approaches to Improving the Test Process_

Improvements to the test process can be achieved by focusing on certain individual aspects described below. Note that these aspects are also covered within the context of the models mentioned in Section 2.5.1.

## **2.5.4.1 Test Process Improvement by Developing People’s Skills**

Improvements to testing may be supported by providing increased understanding, knowledge and skills to people and teams who are carrying out tests, managing testing or making decisions based on

Page 18 of 75

testing. These may be testers, test managers, developers and other IT team members, other managers, users, customers, auditors and other stakeholders.

Increase in skills and competence may be provided by training, awareness sessions, mentoring, coaching, networking with peer groups, using knowledge management repositories, reading and other educational activities.

Skill levels may be associated with career paths and professional progression, for example, the SFIA

(Skills Framework for the Information Age) [SFIA-Web].

Skills and competencies which need to be improved may be in testing, other IT technical skills, management skills, soft skills or domain skills. For example:

- Test knowledge - test principles, techniques, tools, etc.

- Software engineering knowledge - software, requirements, development tooling, etc.

- Domain knowledge - business process, user characteristics, etc.

- Soft skills - communication, effective way of working, reporting, etc.

Skills for test process improvers are covered further in Section 7.3. However, the skills described are needed not just in the improvement team but across the entire test team, especially for senior testers and test managers.

- Increasing awareness of the benefits and limits of test activities / test improvements to the development process and for the business

- Increasing knowledge and skill levels to support activities in the existing or improved test processes

- Increasing competencies of individuals to enable them to carry out the activities

- Establishing clearly defined testing roles and responsibilities

- improving the correlation between increasing competence and rewards, recognition and career progression

- Motivating staff

## **2.5.4.2 Test Process Improvement by using Tools**

Test improvements may be gained by the successful introduction of tools. These may be efficiency improvements, effectiveness improvements, quality improvements or all of these. For example:

- Test management tools align working practices regarding the documentation of test cases and logging defects

- Code coverage tools support the implementation of exit criteria at the component level

Testing tools are implemented with the intention of increasing test efficiency, increasing control over testing or increasing the quality of deliverables. Implementation of testing tools is not trivial and the success of the implementation depends on the selected tool addressing the required improvement, and the implementation process for the tools being successful. These areas were covered in the ISTQB Foundation and Advanced syllabi.

The scope, diversity and areas of application of test tools have increased significantly during the past number of years. When examining potential process improvements in any part of the test process and at all points in the software life cycle, the test process improvement organization should consider whether the introduction of tools will support improvement. By analogy with CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering), CAST (Computer Aided Software Testing) covers a variety of available test tools, classified according to application and platform. The use of such tools may often bring about a considerable improvement in the productivity of the test process.

The process improver can use tools to aid in gathering, analyzing and reporting data, including performing statistical analysis and process modeling.  These are not (necessarily) testing tools.

- The selection and implementation of tools to aid the improvement team in its work, for example statistical and process modeling tools

- The selection of tools that provide appropriate support for an identified improvement, for example static analysis tools to assess code quality during developer-led static testing

- Improvement of the tool selection and implementation process, for example following the causal analysis for problems during a tool implementation pilot

## **2.5.4.3 Test Process Improvement in Different Test Approaches**

The test closure phase is one of the principal phases where a project retrospective or lessons learned review may take place.

Use of continuous improvement cycles is central to many improvement methods. Both sequential and iterative lifecycles may include Post Implementation Reviews, Phase End Reviews, Lessons Learned meetings and other opportunities to gather feedback and implement improvements.

In iterative methodologies with short iterations (for example Agile methodologies) the feedback loops will happen more frequently, and therefore the opportunities to implement improvements are more frequent. For example, Agile development life cycle models such as SCRUM expect a continuous improvement loop as part of the normal project process input, with a project retrospective and improvement of processes (including the test process) at the end of each iteration (“sprint”).

In exploratory testing, each test session is followed by an assessment of where best to focus the testing next. This allows for an improvement cycle at the end of each session.

In scripted/structured approaches to testing, the effort made to draw up the strategy/plan/scripts may mitigate against a desire to implement improvements during the test project. However, it is possible to undertake a lessons learned or other process review at more frequent intervals and use this to refocus and improve testing. In particular when following a risk-based approach, the risk-based tests will need to be changed (improved) to address the new/changed risks as the business, product and project risks change during the life cycle of the system.

## **2.5.4.4 Test Process Improvement Related to Adoption of Standards and Regulations**

Process improvement may be dictated by standards and regulations. For example, the requirements of domain-dictated standards such as the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or regulations such the Sarbanes-Oxley Act(financial sector) of USA, can mean that specific improvements are required to enable work to be performed in that domain.

Compliance to standards may be required for legal, regulatory, or commercial reasons or for improving communication across teams, organizations, or national borders. Standards may also be used to set or measure in-house processes and improvements against benchmarks set by other organizations.

Test process improvement organizations may bring about improvements by selection of appropriate standards (refer to the Advanced Level syllabus for details), and specification of how the standard is to be used. The standard may be used, for example, for the following purposes:

- To achieve compliance and consequently to meet the requirements of an audit process

- As a measurement benchmark for comparison with other organizations

- As a source of ideas and examples to aid choices in improvements

- As a source of standardized practices which may provide better interoperability of systems and processes within a changing network of partner companies

- As a framework for the change process

## **2.5.4.5 Test Process Improvement Focused on Specific Resources**

The management of the test environment, test data and other technical resources may be outside the test team‟s control. If these areas are seen as a focus for improvement, the teams controlling these resources will need to be engaged in the improvement process.

Processes required to set up and manage the test environment include:

Page 20 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- Requirements definition for the environment

- Design, build and verification/test of the environment

- Acceptance of the environment

- Deployment process

- Capacity planning

- Configuration and change management for the environment

- Access control processes

- Booking/scheduling environments within and between teams

- Retirement/dismantling of environments

Processes required to support the design, acquisition and management of test data include:

- Test analysis and design activities

- Test implementation activities

- Backup, restore and archive processes

- Configuration and change management on specific data sets

- Applicable data security procedures (possibly required by law)

Improvements required at an organizational level for resources such as environments and data may include requests for savings in costs and energy usage reductions to meet the social responsibility and environmental targets for the organization. These may be addressed by efficiencies in the deployment and use of the environments and by, for example, the virtualization of environments.

Some process models (see Section 3.3) explicitly include these resources in the assessment and recommendations, but if, for example, an analytical approach such as root cause analysis is used (see Chapter 4), they can be added as factors to be considered.

The focus for improvement teams regarding resources covers the following:

- Identifying improvement areas outside the test team‟s control

- Engaging with the controlling teams, if necessary by escalation through management

- Engaging with improvement teams outside testing to coordinate improvements

- Identifying and implementing improvements within the test team and across test teams for provision and management of resources

## 3.1 Introduction to Model-based Approaches

## _3.1.1 Desirable Characteristics of Test Process Improvement Models_

Test process improvement models can be characterized by the following attributes:

- Easy to use

- Publicly available

- Available support by consultants

- Not a marketing vehicle of a commercial organization

- Accepted by professional bodies

- Include provision for improvement

- Provide many small evolutionary improvements

- Built on a sound basis, meaning it is practical, empirical, theoretical, published and justified

- Provides details of how to assess, identify improvements and make improvements

- Quantifiable improvements

- Tailorable (project-specific)

- The degree to which the model prescribes the improvement activities to be performed

- Support for the order of improvement

- Whether the improvement is represented in a staged or continuous way

- Level of detail on testing content

- Richness and variety of suggested solutions to specific testing problems

- Level of formal accreditation required for assessors

- Certification possible for an organization

## _3.1.2 Continuous and Staged Representations_

## Process models show process maturity using either a staged or a continuous representation.

The staged representation offers a systematic “one step at a time” approach to improvement. The model architecture prescribes the stages that an organization must proceed through so that its test process improves in an orderly fashion. Achieving a stage ensures that an adequate level of process maturity is established (in TMMi, this is called a Maturity Level) before moving up to the next stage. The focus of improvement is on achieving the individual levels of capability for a predefined set of process areas (e.g. Test Planning and Test Environment in TMMi at level 2) which are allocated to a Maturity Level (e.g. TMMi level 4). A maturity level represents a well defined evolutionary plateau towards achieving improved organizational processes.

The advantages of a staged model lie mostly in the simplicity of the concept. It provides a maturity level rating that is often used in external management communication and within qualifying companies (e.g., a customer company may require that all potential supplier companies achieve a minimum process maturity of, say, TMMi level 4). The problem with the staged representation is its limited flexibility. An organization may achieve relatively high levels of capability in many of the required process areas, but still fail to achieve an overall maturity level. A tendency to use this as an “all or nothing” approach or a “once and done” approach can result in not achieving the desired business goals.

Within the continuous representation there are no prescribed maturity levels which the development process is required to proceed through. The TPI Next model uses a form of continuous representation (see Section 3.3.1). An organization applying the continuous representation can select specific areas for improvement from several different categories according to the particular goals it wishes to achieve. Continuous representation permits individual capability levels to be achieved for each process/key area (e.g., in the TPI Next Model the maturity of the key area “Test Strategy” can be achieved at several increasing levels).

Page 23 of 75

The advantages of the continuous representation relate mostly to its flexibility as shown below:

- An organization may choose to improve a single trouble-spot or group of process/key areas which are closely aligned to the organization‟s business objectives

- It is possible to improve different process areas at different rates

- The “all or nothing” disadvantages of the staged model are avoided

## _3.1.3 Assumptions in Using Models_

There are a number of assumptions which are implicitly made when applying a model-based improvement:

- Models describe what their authors consider to be “best practice”. This term may actually be better described as “good practice” which has been shown to provide benefit for improving test processes. It is the responsibility of the test process improver to judge what “best” means for a particular project.

- The use of a model-based approach assumes that conforming to the “best practices” is required in order to improve.

- Models assume that there is such a thing as a “standard“ project and/or organization. Because all projects are in some way different, model-based approaches will not always apply equally well to all projects.

Using models cannot be considered to be a purely mechanical checklist-based procedure; experience and judgment must be properly applied to obtain maximum benefit. Generic models require interpretation in order to take specific project factors into account.

The following examples illustrate some of the factors which may require interpretation of the model:

- Life cycle applied (e.g., traditional V-model or Agile development process)

- Technology used (e.g., web, object-oriented technology)

- System architecture (e.g., distributed systems, SOA, embedded systems)

- Risk level (e.g., for safety critical systems compared to business systems)

- Test approach (e.g., scripted versus exploratory)

- Suitability for use within the context of the organizational unit

There can be a number of problems with using models in general (not just the process improvement models considered in this syllabus). These include:

- Lack of knowledge by the originator of the model

- The model used may oversimplify causes and effects

- The model may be applied in an inappropriate context

- The model is applied without considering if this is useful. It is considered a goal in itself instead of as an instrument for improving the process.

- Belief by the user that following the model implicitly means understanding

- Lack of skills or experience with the model

## 3.2 Software Process Improvement Models

Software Process Improvement (SPI) models typically only cover testing issues in general terms. For this reason test improvement models, like those covered in Section 3.3 of this syllabus, have been developed specifically for the test process.

## _3.2.1 CMMI_

The CMMI can be implemented via two approaches or representations: the staged representation or the continuous one. In the staged representation there are five “levels of maturity”, each level building upon the process areas established in the previous levels. In the continuous representation the

Page 24 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

organization is allowed to concentrate its improvement efforts on its own primary areas of need without regard to other areas.

The staged representation provides more focus for the organization and has the largest uptake in the industry. It also ensure commonality with CMM and can be used to objectively measure an organization's maturity level, while the continuous representation is generally considered to be more flexible.

Within CMMI the process areas of Validation and Verification specifically reference both static and dynamic test processes. The process areas Technical Solution and Product Integration also deal with testing issues.

In addition to the testing related process areas, the following process areas also provide support towards a more structured testing process:

- Project Planning

- Project Monitoring and Control

- Risk Management

- Configuration Management

- Measurement and Analysis

- Causal Analysis and Resolution

Though the relationship between software development and testing is addressed in the CMMI model, dedicated test process models like CTP, STEP, TMMi, and TPI Next provide more detail regarding testing and the test process.

The relationship between CMMI and testing is made more explicit within the TMMi model [TMMiFoundation-Web].

## _3.2.2 ISO/IEC 15504_

ISO/IEC 15504-5 is an international software process improvement standard that defines a number of process categories, including Engineering, Management, Organization, Customer-Supplier and Support. The “Support” process category (SUP) includes individual processes which are relevant to testing, including Verification and Validation. The capability level for each process is evaluated using a predefined set of process attributes and applies a continuous representation approach.

## 3.3 Test Process Improvement Models

An introduction overview of the various types of process improvement models was provided in Section 2.5.1. In this section and in Section 3.4 the major improvement models that are applied in practice are described in more detail.

## _3.3.1 The Test Process Improvement Model (TPI®)_

The ISTQB Certified Tester Advanced Syllabus describes the TPI model [Koomen / Pol 99] and states learning objectives which are relevant for the test manager. In 2009 its successor was released: TPI Next [Sogeti 09].

The TPI Next model is a process model which distinguishes all major aspects of a test process. Accordingly central elements of the TPI Next model are sixteen key areas, each of which covers a specific aspect of the test process, such as test strategy, metrics, test tools and test environment.

A thorough analysis of key areas is supported by various maturity levels per key area, each defined by specific checkpoints. Clusters of checkpoints from multiple key areas are defined that make up small

Page 25 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

improvement steps. The usage of clusters reduces the risk of “one-sided” improvement (e.g., it is not recommended to achieve high maturity levels in the metrics key area before certain levels of maturity have been achieved for the defect management and reporting key areas). As a result the TPI Next model uses a form of continuous representation but still prescribes certain process improvements to its key areas in a certain order.

By means of a maturity matrix which covers all key areas, findings are summarized and visualized. When the outcome of the analysis is consolidated across all key areas a maturity level can be attributed to the whole test process. These maturity levels are named initial, controlled, efficient and optimizing.

Numerous prioritized improvement suggestions reflecting good testing practice are available to assist in the definition of a suitable development path. The definition of improvement objectives and their implementation can be tailored according to the needs and capacity of the test organization.

The generic approach makes TPI Next independent of any SPI model. It covers both the test engineering aspects as well as support for managerial decision making.

The original TPI model has been adapted for specific industries. An example of this is “Automotive TPI” which defines an extra key area (“integration”) and has been adopted by German car manufacturers.

Mapping exists between TPI Next and the software process improvement models CMMI and ISO/IEC 15504 mentioned in Section 3.2.

## _3.3.2 The Testing Maturity Model Integration (TMMi)_

The ISTQB Certified Tester Advanced Syllabus describes the TMMi model and states learning objectives which are relevant for the test manager.

TMMi [TMMi-Foundation-Web] has a staged architecture for process improvement. It defines the following levels or maturity levels through which an organization passes as its testing process evolves from an ad-hoc status:

- Initial

- Managed

- Defined

- Management and measurement

- Optimization

The five maturity levels in the TMMi prescribe a maturity hierarchy and an evolutionary path to test process improvement. Achieving each stage ensures that an adequate improvement has been laid as a foundation for the next stage. The internal structure of the TMMi is rich in testing practices that can be learned and applied in a systematic way to support a quality testing process that improves in incremental steps.

Each maturity level in TMMi has a set of process areas that an organization needs to focus on to achieve maturity at that level. For example, the process areas at TMMi level 2 “Managed” are:

- Test Policy and Strategy

- Test Planning

- Test Monitoring and Control

- Test Design and Execution

- Test Environment

The model structure of the TMMi is largely based on the structure of the CMMI. This is a major benefit because many people/organizations are already familiar with the CMMI structure. The CMMI structure makes a clear distinction between practices that are required (goals) or recommended (specific practices, typical work products, etc.) to implement.

## _3.3.3 Comparing TPI Next to TMMi_

This section provides a brief comparison of the two test process improvement models covered in this syllabus. Depending on the specific project context and the improvement objectives to be followed, one of the two models could be preferred.

Some differences between TMMi and TPI Next are shown in the table below:

|**Aspect**|**TPI Next**|**TMMi**|

## 3.4 Content-based Models

Content-based models allow testing processes to be improved by providing a structured description of good testing practices together with an overall approach to be followed. The content-based models described in this syllabus are STEP and CTP.

## _3.4.1 STEP_

Systematic Test and Evaluation Process (STEP) [Craig02] does not require that improvements occur in a specific order. For these purposes the STEP assessment model can be blended with the TPI (Next) model.

The STEP methodology is based upon the idea that testing is a lifecycle activity that begins during requirements formulation and continues until retirement of the system.

The Advanced syllabus provides details of the following:

- Basic premises for the methodology

- Examples of the quantitative metrics taken

- Examples of qualitative factors

## _3.4.2 CTP_

The basic premise of the Critical Testing Process (CTP) [Black03] assessment model is that certain testing processes are critical. These critical processes, if performed well, will support successful test teams. The model identifies twelve critical testing processes.

A CTP assessment identifies which processes are strong and which are weak, and provides prioritized recommendations for improvement based on organizational needs. A number of quantitative and qualitative metrics are commonly examined during a CTP assessment.

Once an assessment has identified weak areas, plans for improvement are put into place. Generic improvement plans are provided by the model for each of the critical testing processes, but the assessment team is expected to tailor those heavily.

## 4.1 Introduction

Analytical approaches are problem-based. Improvements to be introduced are based on actual problems and objectives rather than the generic model of ”best practices“ used in model-based approaches and content-based approaches like those described in Chapter 3.

Data analysis is essential for objective test process improvement and a valuable support to purely qualitative assessments, which might otherwise result in imprecise recommendations that are not supported by data.

Applying an analytical approach to improvement involves the analysis of a test process in order to identify problem areas and set project-specific goals. The definition and measurement of key parameters is required to evaluate whether improvement measures have succeeded.

Analytical approaches may be used together with a content-based approach to verify results and provide diversity as is the case with Critical Test Processes (CTP). Also model-based approaches sometimes address analytical approaches as one or more separate key areas with the model as is the case with TMMi.

Generally speaking, analytical approaches may also be applied to the task of test management. Test managers apply them at a project level, test process improvers apply them at the process level.

## 4.2 Causal Analysis

Causal analysis is the study of problems to identify their possible root causes. This allows identification of solutions which will remove the causes of problems and not just address the immediately obvious symptoms. If causal analysis is not used, attempts to improve test processes may fail because the actual root causes are not addressed and the same or similar problems recur.

Many software process improvement models emphasize the use of causal analysis as a means of continually improving the maturity of the software process.

The following systematic methods for causal analysis are described below as examples:

- Cause-Effect diagrams (Ishikawa fishbone diagrams)

- Causal analysis during an inspection process

- Use of standard anomaly classifications

Note: other methods are available for causal analysis (see Advanced syllabus) and also checklists of common causes may be used as an input to the causal analysis, for example when carrying out causal analysis on defects.

## _4.2.1 Cause-Effect Diagrams_

Cause-Effect diagrams (also known as Ishikawa fishbone diagrams: Ishikawa fishbone diagrams) were developed for the manufacturing and other industries [Ishikawa 91] and have been adopted in the IT industry [Juran]. These diagrams provide a mechanism to identify and discuss root causes under a number of headings.

The steps to apply, (according to [Robson 95]), are described as:

1. Write the effect on the right hand side of the diagram

2. Draw in the ribs and label them according to their context. The ownership of the fishbone is with a work group rather than with management.

3. Remind the work group of the rules of brainstorming:

- No criticism – all ideas are accepted at this stage

- Freewheel – random, crazy ideas are welcome as are ideas that build on other people‟s ideas

- Quantity of ideas – a large number of ideas is to be generated

- Record all ideas – including random, crazy and repeating ideas

- Don‟t evaluate the ideas now – having brainstormed, have a rest before evaluating the ideas

4. Use the brainstorming method – possible causes are brainstormed and added to the ribs of the diagram. For each first level cause, checklists are used to identify the underlying root causes, which may be on a different part of the diagram.

5. Incubate the ideas for a period of time

6. Analyze the diagram to look for clusters of causes and symptoms. Use the Pareto idea (80% of the gain from 20% of the effort) to identify clusters that are candidates to solve.

Cause Effect diagrams may also be used to work from the effects back to the causes, as noted in [BS7925-2] and [Copeland 03].

## _4.2.2 Causal Analysis during an Inspection Process_

The inspection process is described in the ISTQB Foundation syllabus and expanded in the ISTQB Advanced syllabus. Using the software inspection process [Gilb & Graham] suggests a different approach to causal analysis.

The causal analysis meeting is a facilitated discussion which lasts two hours and follows a set timescale and format.

- The selection of defects to be considered may be taken by the inspection leader or in the context of a project retrospective. Alternatively the issues to be discussed may identified in the first part of the analysis.

- Part 1: Defect analysis (90 minutes) looks at specific defects and their specific causes

- Part 2: Generic analysis (30 minutes) focuses on identifying broad trends in the defects. The team looks for trends, commonalities and what has recently gone well, improved or gone wrong. Defect taxonomies (introduced in the Advanced syllabus) can be a valuable support for this analysis. Generic analysis may also focus on particular defects found in dynamic testing to provide risk-based inputs for the future testing strategy.

- The discussion must ensure that the number and severity of the defects being considered maximizes the return on the invested time.

In the defect analysis, each defect is categorized with:

- A defect description - this is not the defect symptom but the defect itself

- A cause category - e.g., communication, oversight, education, transcription error, process

- A cause description - for the cause and any chain of cause events

- The process step when the defect was created - this is not always where it was detected

- Suggested actions to eliminate the cause - these must be specific and achievable

## _4.2.3 Use of Standard Anomaly Classifications_

Standards such as [IEEE 1044] allow a common classification of anomalies allowing an understanding of the project stages when faults are introduced, the project activities when faults are detected, the cost of rectifying the faults, the cost of failures, and the stage where the defect was raised versus where it was found (also known as Defect Leakage).

A common classification allows statistics about improvement areas to be analyzed across an organization. This classification must be introduced via training, tools and support so that anyone using the incident management system understands when to use the classifications and how to interpret them. This information may be used in the improvement of the development and test process to identify areas where improvement will be cost effective and to track the success of improvement initiatives. The defects to be analyzed will be recorded from all life cycle phases, including maintenance and operation.

## _4.2.4 Selecting Defects for Causal Analysis_

The application of methods described above may require the selection of specific defects for analysis from a potentially large collection. The following approaches can be taken in combination to selecting defects for analysis:

- Pareto analysis (20% of defects considered representative of all)

- Outliers in statistics (e.g., using values of statistical variation, such a 3-sigma, on a particular metric)

- Project retrospectives

- Use of defect severity categories

## 4.3 The GQM Approach

The Goal-Question-Metric GQM approach [BasiliPapers], [Trienekens & van Veenendaal 97] applies the following steps to define suitable metrics:

- Setting specific goals

- Deriving questions that when answered will provide information about the achievement of the goals

- Deriving metrics which, when measured, will provide the answers to the questions

Basili‟s approach with GQM is to provide a measuring mechanism for feedback and evaluation. GQM allows measurement to be:

- Focused on setting specific goals

- Applied to all parts of the software life cycle products, process and resources

- Interpreted based on characterization and understanding of the organizational context, environment and goals

Thus, the measurements appropriate in one organization may not be appropriate in another organization. The definition of the goals and questions allows the appropriate metrics to be selected or defined, and hence the appropriate data collected and analyzed.

The three levels in the GQM approach are:

1. Conceptual level – the GOALS for the organization, with regard to the quality of products, processes and resources (note: resources include people, offices, hardware, software).  This might include any of the definitions of quality from Chapter 2, so productivity as well as manufacturing excellence could be a goal. Forms can be used to define goals.

2. Operational level – the QUESTIONS which characterize products, processes and resources with respect to their quality – Basili refers to these as the objects of measurement

3. Quantitative level – the METRICS which may be objective (quantitative, factual) or subjective (qualitative, viewpoints)

Goals may give rise to one or more questions, and questions may give rise to one or more metrics. The goals, questions and metrics may be associated with the quality views described in Chapter 2, and/or with the results measurement required by organizational and IT frameworks for improvement described in Chapter 2.

## 4.4 Analysis using Measures, Metrics and Indicators

## _4.4.1 Introduction_

Measures, metrics and indicators form part of all improvement programs. This applies regardless of whether these improvements are carried out formally or informally. It is also regardless of whether the data are quantitative or qualitative, objective or subjective. The feelings of the people affected by the improvement are a valid measure of progress toward improvement.

Measures, metrics and indicators initially help to target areas and opportunities for improvement. They are required continuously in improvement initiatives in order to control the improvement process and to make sure that the changes have resulted in the desired improvements.

Measures, metrics and indicators can be collected at all stages of the software life cycle, including development, maintenance and use in production [Nance & Arthur 02]. They are also used for deriving other metrics and indicators. Note that for all items mentioned in Section 4.4.2 which relate to defects, it is important to make a distinction between the various priority and severity levels of the defects found. Specific measures, metrics and indicators may also be applied by test managers, in particular for the project level tasks of test estimation and for progress monitoring and control. Test process improvers will apply measures, metrics and indicators at the process level.

## _4.4.2 Test Effectiveness Metrics_

## **4.4.2.1 Defect Detection Percentage (DDP)**

The first indicator that can be used in almost any test improvement process, and is highly recommended by most test experts, is the Defect Detection Percentage (DDP). If you‟ve found most (if not all) of the important defects during testing, and users/customers found few during real-life usage, your testing is good.

Defect Detection Percentage is defined as the number defects found by testing divided by the total known defects. The DDP can be calculated per test stage (e.g. integration, alpha testing, beta testing) or for all test stages together. DDP is a calculable metric after a project is finished and some time (e.g., three or six months) has passed in which residual defects may be found.

## **4.4.2.2 Post-release Defect Rate**

This indicator is defined as the number of defects found by customers during a certain period after release of the product per Kilo Lines Of Code (KLOC). If this rate decreases then the customers‟ perceived quality will increase.

Note: these defect metrics give information for the “manufacturing” view of quality as was discussed in Chapter 2.

## _4.4.3 Test Efficiency / Cost Metrics_

## **4.4.3.1 Organizational Cost of Quality**

To sell the idea of test improvement to others we need to show the benefit for them. To do this it is important to show the cost benefit of test activities and of improvement to testing, by measuring the cost of testing and improvement as well as the cost of not testing (i.e., the cost of failure).

## **4.4.3.2 Cost of Quality Ratio**

Ratio of „total effort spent on static testing (e.g., inspections and reviews)‟ and „total effort spent on dynamic testing (e.g., unit, integration, system test)‟. If this ratio increases then the efficiency of the defect removal process will increase.

## **4.4.3.3 Early Defect Detection**

As stated in the previous performance indicator, the efficiency of the defect removal process will increase if defects are found earlier in the process. Not only is this applicable for static versus dynamic testing but also for unit and integration versus system and acceptance testing. The performance indicator „Early Defect Detection‟ measures the total number of defects found during unit and integration testing (early dynamic testing) versus the total number of defects found during dynamic testing.

## **4.4.3.4 Relative Test Effort**

A basic indicator is the ratio of the total test effort (or cost) versus the total project effort (or cost) prerelease. Post-release effort spent on activities such as maintenance and after-sales support is not taken into account.

## **4.4.3.5 Test Efficiency**

This indicator is based on the number and severity of defects found compared to the testing effort spent (per test level). The indicator is used to determine if the test effort is focused on the finding of high severity defects. Test efficiency may also be related to the size of the test assignment, such as test points.

## **4.4.3.6 Automation Level**

The ratio of the number of test cases executed automatically versus the total number of test cases executed (both manually and automatically).

## **4.4.3.7 Test Productivity**

The total number of test cases (or test design) for the product related to the total test effort required. Of course this performance indicator can also be measured per test phase.

Note: these efficiency/cost metrics give information for the “value” view of quality (see Chapter 2).

## _4.4.4 Lead-time Metrics_

The lead-time of testing is especially important during test execution, since test execution is on the critical-path of the project. Lead-time is defined as the period (in days or weeks) between two milestones that identify the start and end of one or more project activities. The test execution lead-time indicator to test the product should of course be related to the size of the product. This indicator can be measured per test phase, e.g. alpha or beta.

## _4.4.5 Predictability metrics_

## **4.4.5.1 Test Execution Lead-time Slippage**

The difference between the actual and estimated test execution lead-time required for one or more test phases related to the estimated test execution lead-time.

For improvement purposes it is often interesting to measure test lead-time slippage against the estimation made at the beginning of the project and against the estimation made at the beginning of the test execution phase.

## **4.4.5.2 Effort Slip (or cost)**

The difference between the actual and estimated effort (or cost) required for one or more test phases related to the estimated effort (or cost).

## **4.4.5.3 Test Case Slip**

The difference between the actual and estimated number of test cases (or test designs) required for one or more test phases related to the estimated number of test cases (or test designs).

## _4.4.6 Product Quality Metrics_

## **4.4.6.1 Metrics for Quality Attributes**

A number of attributes are available with which product quality can be described. (e.g., functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability). These are documented in [ISO 9126] and its successor [ISO 25000]. The attributes and the indicators associated with them are described in the ISTQB Advanced Level syllabus. For example, indicators associated with the software quality attribute reliability may take the form of Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).

The test process is one of the primary sources of information for measuring these software quality attributes. The capability of the test process to deliver meaningful and relevant product quality information may be considered an area for potential test process improvement.

## **4.4.6.2 Coverage Indicators**

The coverage of requirements and code achieved by testing may be used as indicators of product quality (assuming that higher product quality is related to higher coverage levels) during testing.

Page 34 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

Requirements coverage is defined as the number of requirements tested compared to the total number of requirements that has been defined. This can be refined by making a distinction between the number of requirements tested and the number of requirements tested and passed. If coverage increases testing is becoming better and it is expected that product quality also will increase.

Code coverage is defined as the percentage of the total software code that is executed during testing. Various levels of code coverage are described in the ISTQB Foundation syllabus.

These give information for the “product” view of quality (see Chapter 2).

## _4.4.7 Test Maturity Metrics_

These metrics represent the organization‟s test maturity level in the terms used by models such as the Test Maturity Model (TMMi) or the Test Process Improvement (TPI Next) model. If the maturity increases then the risk of not satisfying test objectives regarding quality, lead-time and costs will decrease. Refer to the Advanced Level syllabus for further details.

Please note that these metrics address the manufacturing, product and value quality views described in the Chapter 2, but are not direct measures of the user's view of quality. Test managers may therefore want to measure user quality by taking specific measures of user / customer satisfaction, measuring usability characteristics, (especially relating to task efficiency and effectiveness), or by qualitative measures of stakeholder views.

Regarding test improvement models, it may also be helpful to consider the list of general model characteristics described in Section 3.1.1 when making choices.

**Process models** (e.g. TMMi, TPI Next) are best applied when:

- A test process already exists, although they can also be useful for establishing test processes

- Comparisons or benchmarking is required between similar projects

- Compatibility with software process improvement models is required

- Company policy is to attain a specific maturity level (e.g., TMMi Level 3)

- A well-defined starting point with a predefined path of improvement is desired

- A measure of test maturity is needed e.g., for marketing purposes

- Process models are respected and accepted in the organization

**Content models** (e.g. CTP, STEP) are best applied when:

- A test process needs to be established

- An assessment to identify costs and risks associated with the current test process is needed

- Improvements do not need to be implemented in the order specified by TMMi or TPI Next, but rather in the order determined by business needs

- Tailoring is required to ensure the test process fits the company‟s specific context

- Discontinuous, rapid improvements and changes to the existing test process are desired or needed

**Analytic approaches** are best applied when:

- Specific problems need to be targeted

- Measures and metrics are available or can be established and taken

- Evidence for the need of a test process is required

- Agreement is needed about the reasons for change

- The root cause of the problem is not necessarily in the control or influence of the test process owner

- A small scale evaluation or improvement pilot is required/budgeted for

- A pilot is required to see whether a larger scale investigation or improvement program is needed

- To test hypotheses and gather evidence about the causes, symptoms and effects of problems and of proposed improvements

- The organization culture values/trusts internally developed analysis based on local evidence above externally built models (reference or content)

- Stakeholders from many areas are to be involved personally in the analysis (for example in brainstorming sessions)

## 6.1 Introduction

Test process improvement should be a stated objective within an organization‟s testing policy (refer to the Advanced syllabus for more details on Test Policy). An organization's test process improvement policy should be based on the overall test policy. Effective test process improvement requires a systematic process. In Section 2.4 the generic improvement process was introduced by describing the Deming cycle and the IDEAL[SM] process improvement framework. As an example, in this chapter, the process for improvement is covered in more detail using the IDEAL improvement framework as a basis [IDEAL 96]. This approach can be applied to any life cycle model. Each section described below relates to one of the principal IDEAL activities:

- Initiating

- Diagnosing

- Establishing

- Acting

- Learning

## 6.2 Initiating the Improvement Process

Initiating process improvement is perhaps the most important step in the process of test process improvement. Actions taken at this initial stage directly influence the final results of the improvement process. Poorly initialized improvement processes may deliver unsatisfactory results and significantly reduce the chances of being able to take any future improvement initiatives.

The IDEAL model describes the following high-level activities at the “Initiating” phase:

- Identify stimulus for improvement

- Set context and establish sponsorship

- Establish an improvement infrastructure (i.e., organization)

Based on the high-level activities of the IDEAL model, the following must be taken into account at this phase:

- The actual need for improvement must be established

- Objectives need to be defined and aligned to the business needs

- The scope of improvement must be established

- An improvement strategy must be selected (see Chapter 5)

- The influence of people and culture must be taken into account

## _6.2.1 Establishing the Need for Improvement_

As a first step in establishing the need for improvement, some awareness should be generated about process improvement. The more obvious needs for improvements to test processes arise from major software failures with several such failures having been attributed to poor test processes. There is, however, a wide range of different motivations for change. These may originate from one or more of the following stakeholders:

- Management /customer (e.g., more effective testing, less trouble in production)

- User (e.g., better usability)

- Developer (e.g., better support for defect analysis)

- Tester (e.g., establish more systematic testing)

- Maintenance (e.g., less time needed to test software changes)

Areas for improvement may be captured and defined based on preliminary analysis and interviews with stakeholders (refer to Section 7.3 for required skills of interviewing and analysis). As part of the analysis it may be necessary to determine current indicators such as the total cost of quality, based on

Page 39 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

the total cost of failures in production and the total cost of testing (see Section 4.4.3.1 Organizational Cost of Quality and Section 6.2.2).

## _6.2.2 Setting Objectives for Test Improvement_

The main objectives of a test process improvement must always be established in relation to quality, cost, time, and business value. Setting objectives for test improvement requires three principal steps:

- Establish a general vision for the (improved) future

- Set specific objectives

- Align testing improvement to business goals

The objectives for test improvement are typically documented in the organization‟s test policy.

## **6.2.2.1 Establish a General Vision for the Future**

Test process improvement must focus on the benefits required by a sponsoring stakeholder and a vision of the overall objectives to be achieved.

Improvement initiatives need such a vision of the future because, for example,:

- Sponsors need to be convinced of the return on investment before committing resources

- The management of any necessary changes must relate to agreed objectives

Failure to define a common vision may result in failure of the proposed test improvements (see Chapter 9) because:

- Poorly defined objectives may hide unresolved conflicts of interest

- We may focus on inappropriate or unachievable objectives which may be a waste of resources or a failure to improve

## **6.2.2.2 Setting specific objectives**

Specific, well-defined objectives are needed for any test process improvement. These enable:

- The appropriate actions to be taken

- The success (or failure) of the improvement efforts to be defined

A number of possibilities are available to enable objectives to be represented:

- Qualitative objectives, perhaps supported by appropriate scales (e.g., from “very bad” to “very good” or “getting better” to “getting worse”) or questionnaires

- Quantitative objectives with metrics. For example, the Goal, Question, Metric (GQM) method (see Section 4.3) enables metrics to be defined and can be used to link objectives (goals) with measurable results.

- Objectives expressed as maturity levels. If test process improvement is to be conducted using a process model, objectives may also be represented in a form appropriate for the model in question. This typically involves defining specific levels of maturity to be achieved either for the test process as a whole or for individual aspects of the test process.

## **6.2.2.3 Aligning Testing Improvements to the Organization**

Test process improvements must be aligned to

- Business goals

- Any software process improvements being performed

- Organizational improvements (see Chapter 2)

- Organizational structure

Corporate dashboards and balanced scorecards can be used by the organization to allow test improvements to be aligned to organizational improvement targets, such as:

- Financial targets - for example, productivity improvements, improved revenue, improved profit, improved financial turnover, also aligned to the value view of quality

- Improved product quality - aligned to the product, manufacturing and user views of quality

Page 40 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- Customer targets - for example, improved market share, improved customer satisfaction, improved risk management process, also aligned to the user view of quality

- Internal targets - for example, greater predictability of project outcomes, reduced faults/failures during the software development, reduced project elapsed time and reduced effort/costs aligned to the manufacturing view of quality. Offshoring or outsourcing may also be considered as internal targets as this can be especially effective at reducing the cost of the testing process and enabling businesses to focus on their core areas of competence.

- Innovation and improvement targets - new marketplaces/industries, increased number of new products to market, speed to market, and process/framework/standards accreditation (e.g. CMMI or industry standard) aligned to the value view of quality

- People targets - for example, job satisfaction, staff turnover, sickness and other absence reduced which may align to any of the quality views but will also affect the transcendent view of quality (trust, reputation)

- Social involvement/political targets - for example, environmental impact of the organization, reputation and publicity which may align to any of the quality views but will also affect the transcendent view of quality (trust, reputation)

## _6.2.3 Setting the Scope for Improvement_

The issues which must be addressed in order to set the scope of test process improvement include:

- General process scope - other processes which are in scope other than the test process

- Test process scope - the parts of the test process to be addressed

- Test levels - which test levels are within the scope of the improvement program

- Project scope - are project(s) or the organization in scope?

## **6.2.3.1 General Process Scope**

The scope for improvement may involve aspects of the software development process in general, such as project management, requirements management and configuration management. It is important to appreciate whether the stated improvement goals can actually be achieved by improving the test process or whether other processes (e.g., service management, development, and supporting processes described in [ITIL]) must also be improved. If this is the case, further resources and expertise may be required.

## **6.2.3.2 Test Process Scope**

The focused improvement of individual areas of a testing process may be more cost-effective than considering all possible areas. It may be desired to improve all aspects of the test process on a broad front or to only address specific aspects (e.g., test planning).

If the scope of test improvement is limited to specific aspects, care should be taken to consider all other dependencies. Improvement limited to only specific aspects may lead to sub-optimization. Does it make sense, for example, to focus improvement efforts on establishing a testing metrics program when they are unused (e.g., not used in test reporting)?

## **6.2.3.3 Project Scope**

A test improvement program may be organized in a program/project-centric or organization-centric manner.

Program/project-centric improvements are focused on an individual project or group of projects (i.e. program). Assessments, also called audits, are generally performed with project testing staff (e.g., testers, test managers). The scope of test process improvement considered may be limited to a relatively small set of process-related tasks, such as test planning or testing techniques. Such highlyfocused improvement programs may be particularly cost-effective provided that the test process scope is carefully chosen as noted in Section 6.2.3.2.

Page 41 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

Program/project-centric improvements may produce relatively quick results but may fail to address problems at an organizational level. Improvements at an organizational level may be longer lasting and more widely beneficial, but generally take longer to achieve and cost more to implement.

Organization-centric improvements are focused on a testing organization, department or group. In addition to the assessment of individual projects, the organization as a whole is in focus. Aspects of the test process which apply to all projects are especially in focus (e.g., training, organization).

In the IDEAL model‟s “Initializing” phase a process improvement infrastructure is established [IDEAL 96]. This considers the structural organization of the test improvement program. Section 7.1 considers these issues in further detail.

## _6.2.4 Influence of People and Culture on the Initializing Phase_

A number of people-related factors can have an influence on achieving improvement objectives. At the initializing phase the following critical success factors are significant:

- Level of knowledge

- Organizational culture

- People culture

- Level of acceptance

Chapters 7, 8 and 9 have additional information concerning the soft skills needed by the improvement team and the effect of human factors on change management and organizational culture.

Recommendations for test improvement should be sensitive to people issues and be able to suggest alternative improvement strategies depending on the styles, culture and needs of the people in the organization.

## 6.3 Diagnosing the Current Situation

The IDEAL model describes the following high-level activities for the “Diagnosing” phase:

- Appraise and characterize current practice

- Develop recommendations and document phase results

The end result of this phase is typically a test assessment report.

Based on the high-level activities of the IDEAL model, the following considerations must be taken into account in this phase:

- Planning the assessment

- Preparing for the assessment

- Performing interviews

- Giving feedback

- Analyzing results

- Performing solution analysis

- Recommending improvement actions

The activities performed in this phase depend on the approach to be taken to test process improvement (see Chapter 5).

If an analytical-based approach is to be adopted (see Chapter 4) the various causal analysis techniques (Section 4.2) may be applied and metrics, measures and indicators (Section 4.4) analyzed.

If a model-based approach is to be used (see Chapter 3) then an assessment will be planned and performed. Sections 6.3.1 to 6.3.3 cover these aspects in more detail.

Page 42 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

## _6.3.1 Planning the Assessment_

An Assessment Plan clearly identifies the following activities and schedules them:

- Assessment preparation:

- Preliminary analysis

- Preparation of interview materials, such as checklists

- Gathering existing testware material (e.g., test plans, test specifications)

- Interviews with different roles involved in the test process:

- Tester

- Test manager

- Developer

- Project manager

- Business owners

- Business analysts (domain experts)

- Specialists such as environment manager, defect manager, release manager, automation specialists

- Specific areas to be covered in each interview

- Initial feedback to be provided after completion of the assessment (dates, formats, expectations)

- Information to be presented to the interviewee regarding the next steps to be taken

The Assessment Plan must ensure that all testing areas are covered according to the agreed objectives (Section 6.2.2) and scope (Section 6.2.3) agreed on in the initializing phase. For specific areas it may be advisable to cover the same subject in different interviews to enable consistency checks to be conducted.

## _6.3.2 Assessment Preparation_

A preliminary analysis of documents is often performed before interviews are conducted. If the assessment scope is at the organizational level then test policy, test process description, available templates and master test plans may be in focus. If the scope is at project/program level, then test plans, test specifications and test reports may be selected. Documents from other stakeholders (development, business, etc.) may also be relevant if in scope (see Section 6.2.3).

The purpose of the analysis is:

- To gain insights into the current testing process prior to interviewing those involved

- To prepare particular questions for the interview

- To perform formal elements of the assessment which do not require discussion. For example, the documents may be checked to ensure completeness and conformity to standards.

- Prior to performing interviews it is recommended that a suitable environment should be made available. The environment should be:

- Comfortable

- Free from disturbances

- Private

## _6.3.3 Performing Interviews_

Interviews are performed according to the Assessment Plan (see Section 6.3.1). The content of interviews is generally guided by the model being used (see Chapter 3).

Interviews are mostly conducted on an individual basis to allow the interviewee freedom to express views and to ensure that a “secure” environment exists. The interviewer should always discuss the importance of confidentiality for interviewees and information providers prior to an assessment taking

Page 43 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

place, particularly if sensitive issues are expected. For this reason it is recommended that a person is not interviewed in the presence of their superior.

People who give information may be motivated to be honest if:

- Confidentiality is ensured

- Recognition for improvement ideas is given

- No fear of punishment or failure exists

- They know and understand how the information they provide will be used

A wide range of skills are required for the conduct of a successful interview. These are described in more detail in Section 7.3.1.

## _6.3.4 Initial Feedback_

Shortly after completion of interviews an initial feedback may be given, typically as a short presentation or walkthrough. This is particularly helpful in confirming initial assessment findings with the interviewee, for clarifying any misunderstandings, or for providing an overview of main points to stakeholders. Care should be taken to maintain the rules of confidentiality at all times and to avoid assigning blame for any problems identified.

## _6.3.5 Analysis of Results_

If an analytical approach to improvement is being used (Chapter 4), the current situation may be analyzed by applying concepts such as:

- Systems Thinking [Weinberg 92]

- Tipping Points [Gladwell]

Systems Thinking helps analyze the relationships between different system (process) components and to represent those relationships as stable (“balancing”) loops or reinforcing loops. A reinforcing loop may have a negative effect (“vicious circle”) or a positive effect (“virtuous circle”).

Tipping Points help identify specific points in a system where a small, well-focused improvement may break a vicious circle and set off a chain reaction of further improvements.

When a model-based approach (Chapter 3) for test process improvement is followed, a comparison is made between the process maturity of the current situation and the desired objectives defined at the initializing phase.

Where appropriate benchmarks are available, these should be used in evaluating results. The following benchmarks may be used, where available:

- Company-based, representing an entire organization

- Industry-based, where possible relating to the same business segment

- Project-based, where the comparison is made with a specific project that is regarded as meeting the desired objectives

Where key performance indicators have been established (see Section 4.4 and Section 6.2.2), these should be incorporated into the analysis. For example, if the Defect Density Percentage (DDP) has fallen below the required level, an analysis of faults found in production should be performed to evaluate their sources.

The result of the evaluation should provide sufficient information with which to define recommendations and support the planning process (see Sections 6.3.7 and 6.4 below).

## _6.3.6 Performing Solution Analysis_

Solution analysis is used to identify potential solutions to problems and then to choose between those solutions. Any chosen improvement(s) or solution(s) may be decided in a number of ways:

Page 44 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- **Pre-conception** of the right improvement solution – we have already decided what the solution is to the problem e.g., “let‟s automate everything”. This means that a solution analysis stage is not carried out with the disadvantage that the preconceived solution may not address the root cause of the problem and may even make it worse.

- **Recommended solutions** may be built into the model used for the assessment as key practices/areas with the advantage of external evidence for a practice‟s usefulness being available. The disadvantage here is that the “next practice to adopt” in the model may not address the root cause of the problem in this circumstance and may even make it worse.

- **Requirements** from a customer or stakeholder, for example a customer may demand that all its suppliers are ISO9001:2008 accredited, with the advantage that the goal and focus are very clear but the disadvantage that the requested change in processes may not provide an improvement or may conflict with other planned improvements.

- Based on a **solution analysis** of information gathered about the problems, with the advantage that both the negative and positive consequences of each proposed solution are discussed, and consequently solutions selected are positively beneficial and have minimal negative side effects, but with the disadvantage that the analysis process takes time, resources and money.

- A **tailored** method of selecting a solution, based on a mix of the above e.g., a stakeholder requests adoption of TMMi level 4 and a cost-benefit analysis is carried out resulting in a decision to aim for a partial adoption of TMMi level 3. The advantage of this is that the solution analysis is focused, and the disadvantage is that the analysis process takes time, resources and money.

The solution analysis process includes one or more of the following, depending on the method chosen:

- Prioritizing problems and root causes in order to choose which solutions will be developed

- Identifying cost advantages and other benefits, including the risks of NOT implementing the solution

- Identifying costs, risks and negative affects of implementing the solution

- Identifying any constraints on implementing the solutions

- Identifying conflicts, such as solutions which negate each other or are otherwise incompatible Analysis of feedback loops (both virtuous loops and vicious circles) Assessing and prioritizing the solutions

- Performing gap analysis on information and metrics gathered during earlier activities Conducting cost-benefit analysis to provide an estimate of the return on investment

- Constructing “Reversed Fishbone” diagrams, where the fishbone used in Root Cause Analysis is reversed, and solutions brainstormed against the same fishbone headings for a specific root cause identified earlier. Additional headings for constraints may be added, for example budget, resource, time constraints.

## _6.3.7 Recommending Improvement Actions_

An assessment report must relate results to the specified test improvement objectives. The report must be delivered as soon as possible after completion of the assessment, possibly as a preliminary version followed later by a complete version.

As a minimum, the assessment report must include:

- A management summary which refers to the vision statement (see Section 6.2.2.1) A statement of scope and objectives

Page 45 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- Results of the analysis including

- Positive aspects

- Aspects which need improving

- Open issues

- A list of improvement recommendations

Where possible, recommendations should be thought of as improvement requirements (e.g., “provide tool support for a defect tracking system”) which may be implemented in a number of different ways (e.g., “use tool XYZ and provide training”). The implementation task is covered in Section 6.5.

An improvement recommendation should include the following information:

- A unique identifier (for traceability)

- The impact of the recommendation on one or more stated objectives (where possible using a scale to indicate the degree of fulfillment, such as “minimal”, “partial”, “full” or a percentage value)

- Estimate of cost and benefits

- Implementation timescale (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term)

- Risks of implementation (e.g., high level of resistance expected in the change process, risks to achieving particular improvements)

- Dependencies and assumptions (e.g., assumes that another recommendation is also implemented)

To assist in the planning and tracking of high-level recommendations they should, where possible, be broken down into small steps of improvement with tangible results.

Some process models, such as TPI Next, include specific improvement suggestions to help in the task of creating recommendations.

## 6.4 Establishing a Test Improvement Plan

The IDEAL model describes the following high-level activities for the “Establishing” phase:

- Set priorities

- Develop approach

- Plan actions

The end result of this phase is typically a test improvement plan .

Based on the high-level activities of the IDEAL model, the following considerations must be taken into account in this phase:

- Setting priorities

- Develop an implementation approach

- Planning the actions needed for the improvements

## _6.4.1 Setting Priorities._

The recommendations from the ”establishing” phase are prioritized according to a list of criteria, each of which may be weighted according to the need for the improvement and the stakeholders involved.

At a minimum the following criteria should be considered:

- Duration of improvement - A balance needs to be achieved between short-term and long-term improvements. Short-term improvements (“Quick-Wins”) have the advantage of quickly showing return on investment and may have a strong motivational role on the implementing team. Long-term improvements may address some of the fundamental improvements in the testing process, including cultural and organizational issues.

- Implementation risk - Many improvements require a change to existing testing practices. There is a risk of failure associated with each of those improvements. The following factors will need to be considered:

- Ability to return to an existing state if the improvement has to be abandoned

- Overall impact on the entire improvement program of “key” improvements, especially if other improvements are dependent on the success of this particular measure

- Ability to actually implement the improvement. Are sufficient resources available? Are key members of the improvement team likely to be allocated to other tasks? Can risks be identified within the change process (see Chapter 8), such as resistance to particular changes?

- Cost/benefit of the proposed improvement (possibly expressed as a value of “Return on Investment”)

- Link to objectives - Can a clear association be made between the proposed improvement and the stated objectives of the business?

- Leverage - How much impact will this improvement have on specific objectives (e.g., high, medium, low)?

## _6.4.2 Developing an Implementation Approach._

Recommendations for improvement are considered and prioritized by the stakeholder. A specific approach for implementing the change can then be selected which is closely related to the scope of improvement determined in the initializing phase. The two principal approaches are:

- Top-down

- Bottom-up

Features of the top-down approach are:

- The scope of improvement typically covers several projects or an entire organization

- Ownership of the improvement process may be with a dedicated team

- Detailed analysis of results is required in order to find commonalities (good and bad practices) between the different projects

- Presentation and negotiation skills are particularly relevant in achieving consensus on objectives and recommendations

- The following critical success factors are particularly relevant (see Chapter 9 for details):

- Managing people effectively

- Obtaining sponsorship

- Managing expectations

Features of the bottom-up approach are:

- The scope of improvement typically covers no more than one or two projects

- The selected approach is often less formal. For example, individual projects may choose an analytical approach rather than applying a more formal model-based approach such as TPI Next.

- Ownership of the improvement process is typically within a project team

- A typical objective is the prototyping of particular improvements in order to gain experience and build support

- This approach may be adopted where funding for a test improvement program is limited and costs / benefits first need to be demonstrated

- The results of the bottom-up strategy may be used for a subsequent top-down roll-out of proven improvement measures

## _6.4.3 Planning the Improvements_

The primary planning activities are:

Page 47 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- Agreeing on specific measures based on the recommendations

- Establishing the performance indicators required (see Chapters 2, 4 and 6)

- Prioritizing and combining groups of related improvements into packages (step-wise improvement)

- Linking the improvement issues to the recommendations and required performance indicators for achievement, e.g., by setting up an improvements database to register these

- Deciding on an approach for process improvement (see Section 6.4.2)

- Scheduling the changes

- Establishing groups or teams to implement the improvements (see Section 7.1.1)

- Assigning tasks

- Documenting the above-mentioned points in a test improvement plan

The IDEAL model describes two possible action plans:

- A strategic action plan  having the following characteristics:

- A timescale of three to five years

- Covers the entire organization‟s test process improvements and integrates them with other software process improvement activities and any other total quality management (TQM) initiatives already planned or in process

- A tactical action plan  having the following characteristics:

- A short timescale, typically one year or less

- Focuses on the detailed planning of activities of the Test Process Group (the team responsible for implementing the improvements). See Section 7.1.1 for further details.

## 6.5 Acting to Implement Improvement

The IDEAL model describes the following high-level activities for the “Acting” phase:

- Create solution

- Pilot/Test solution

- Refine solution

- Implement solution

Based on the high-level activities of the IDEAL model, at a minimum the following considerations must be taken into account in this phase:

- Selecting and executing pilots

- Managing and controlling the change

## _6.5.1 Selecting and Executing a Pilot_

Piloting a proposed improvement is an effective way of reducing the risk of failure, gaining experience, building support and reducing the risk of implementation failure. This is especially important where those improvements involve major changes to working practices or place a heavy demand on resources.

Selection of a pilot should balance the following factors:

- Realism - Is the pilot representative of the “real world”? Care should be taken not to select a pilot which is unrealistic just because it offers the chance of a particularly quick or easy implementation.

- Scalability of solution - Can the results from the pilot be used in all contexts? If the pilot is not representative of the complexity and size of real projects there is a risk that the implemented improvement will not scale.

- Impact on current projects - Pilots should not be performed on current projects unless the impact is acceptable. Particular care is required if existing practices are to be replaced by the

Page 48 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

improved practices for the duration of the pilot. A better solution is to run the new practices in parallel with the existing practices, although this may create a resource problem (we cannot expect project employees to perform the same task twice because of the pilot).

- Risk of failure - Even though the use of pilots is a risk-reduction measure, the risk of pilot failure must also be evaluated. The above-mentioned aspects are significant factors in the evaluation of the pilot, which should consider both the financial and motivational risks of failure to the entire improvement project.

## _6.5.2 Manage and Control the Implementation_

The implementation of the Test Improvement Plan is performed, monitored and progress towards achieving improvement goals is reported. The measures, metrics and indicators specified in the Test Improvement Plan are collected and compared to the established objectives.

If the analysis of lessons learned from performing a pilot yields positive results, the decision may be made to roll-out the improvements to other parts of the organization and/or other projects. The roll-out of improvements follows a defined process, especially where an entire organization is affected by the change. Chapter 8 is devoted entirely to this critical aspect of test process improvement.

## 6.6 Learning from the Improvement Program

The IDEAL model describes the following high-level activities for the “Learning” phase:

- Analyze and validate

- Propose future solutions

During and after implementation of the test improvement plan, project retrospectives are performed with the stakeholders and the achieved objectives analyzed. The organization or person which has implemented the improvement usually manages the retrospectives, which are typically performed as workshops.

Depending on the results of this retrospective, further actions may be defined, which may include performing a new improvement cycle, e.g., initiating the diagnosing phase (Section 6.2).

## 7.1 Organization

Implementation of test process improvement can be more effective if an organization is created which ensures the correct implementation and takes on “ownership” of the improvement process (see Section 9.1).This is particularly the case for improvement programs which take place at organizational level. Smaller scale improvement programs must weigh up the value of setting up a separate improvement organization with the costs.

Useful information regarding a test improvement organization is provided by [Burnstein 03] and [IDEAL 96].

Page 50 of 75

## _7.1.1 The Test Process Group_

[Burnstein 03] describes a Test Process Group (TPG) as a group of individuals who may cooperate with other quality-related organizations, such as a Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG).

A TPG should be established as a permanent part of an organization and not just formed on an adhoc basis. This is principally because:

- The scope of ad-hoc improvement groups is often limited to a particular project or an individual problem area. A permanent TPG has a wider scope and can more easily recognize and propose improvement suggestions affecting the organization.

- The implementation of proposed improvement measures can be more effectively controlled by a permanent TPG. With ad-hoc improvement groups there is a risk that they disband before improvements are fully implemented. This absence of adequate control may result in the failure to achieve or report on agreed objectives.

- The many and varied skills which are needed for performing effective test process improvement are best developed within a specialized group

- A permanent TPG can function as the test process “owner” and provides an important channel of communication to principal stakeholders

- Many maturity models (e.g., TMMi) include the permanent TPG as an indicator of higher test process maturity

[Burnstein 03] mentions that an effective TPG is likely to include respected people from a wide range of backgrounds (e.g., management, development, testing) and who can be considered as practitioners. This not only provides valuable insights into the complexities of testing processes, but also increases the level of acceptance for any improvement suggestions proposed (respected practitioners are generally better accepted than pure theorists).

The IDEAL-model [IDEAL 96] describes the establishment of a process improvement organization with the following entities:

- Executive Council (EC)

- Used in very large organizations

- Deals with issues of strategy and direction

- Management Steering Group (MSG)

- Composed of high-level managers from the organization‟s existing management structure

- Sets goals, success criteria and priorities

- Guides implementation activities in the organization

- Supplies the resources

- Sets up TWGs for specific aspects of process improvement

- Technical Working Group (TWG)

- Exists only for the time needed to accomplish their specific goals

- Researches problems and proposes solutions to the MSG

- Performs prototyping activities

- Revises tactical action plan with lessons learned from the prototype

The IDEAL-model includes sample charters for each of these organizational entities.

The test process improvement organization is primarily concerned with process, but should also assume responsibilities for training; permanent process improvement can only be achieved when the people involved also improve continuously. The organization's goals, membership, roles, responsibilities and principal interfaces with other parts of the organization should be stated clearly and aligned with the Test Policy (see Advanced Level syllabus).

## _7.1.2 Test Improvement with Remote, Off-shore and Outsourced teams_

When teams involved in improvement are working in the same organization and on the same site, all parts of the improvement process are easier to organize and carry out than when part of the affected team works in other organizations or on other sites.

Where any part of the SDLC is out-sourced or off-shored, communication of problems, root causes, solutions, evidence and plans for change are likely to be affected. The focus for improvement teams in these cases should be on:

- Any political, cultural or contractual (mis)understandings that may need improvement, may block or discourage proposed improvements, or which may mean improvements are not understood or may affect sensitivities

- Timing of communications with regard to the order in which people are informed of change, as well as considering local holidays, time zones and so on

- Informing and involving all parties in all stages from initiation of the improvement, through information gathering, choice of solutions, pilots and the rollout/change program

- Eliciting feedback from all parties on the success (or otherwise) of the improvement program.

Potential problems can occur when:

- The on-shore test team has a different level of process maturity, efficiency and effectiveness compared with the off-shore/outsource test team

- The expectations of the groups are widely different regarding process, communication and quality culture

- Assumed processes are not aligned

- Attempts at improvement or change on either side cause cultural and communication clashes

## 7.2 Individual Roles

## _7.2.1 The Test Process Improver_

The test process improver must be capable of performing tasks in accordance with this syllabus.

There is a limit to the change that a test process improver can achieve. If, for example, the development managers or the customer control their own testing, this may be outside the influence of the test process improver and necessary changes to their testing processes may be out of scope for the test process improver.

Test process improvers should understand the scope of what they can improve and request support from management and other groups as required. In performing their role, they may be limited to suggesting test process improvements rather than actually implementing them. In organizational improvement programs the test process improver may report to an overall change manager.

## _7.2.2 Assessor Roles_

Due to the many technical and soft skills required to perform assessments (see Section 7.3), a specific assessor role may be assigned.

If a model-based approach is adopted, assessments should be conducted by a person with specific knowledge of the model to be used. In some cases (e.g. TMMi, CMMI, ISO/IEC 15504, EFQM Assessor) this person may require formal training and certification. For example, the TMMi Foundation distinguishes between lead-assessors and assessors (see [TMMi-Foundation-Web] for more information on their roles and the requirements to become an accredited assessor).

## 7.3 Skills of the Test Process Improver/Assessor

The success of conducting test process improvement is dependent on a wide range of skills. These may be technical skills, such as analysis, or non-technical, people-oriented skills, often referred to as ”soft“ skills. The following skills are relevant to both the test process improver and the assessor:

- Interviewing skills

- Listening skills

- Presentational and reporting skills

- Analytical skills

- Note-taking skills

The following additional skills are particularly relevant to the test process improver:

- Skills of persuasion

- Management skills

All of these skills are required by any person performing an assessment. Particular skills may also be required for any member of a Test Process Group / Technical Working Group.

## _7.3.1 Interviewing Skills_

Interviewing can be represented by the following process:

- Opening - Clarify goals and targets

- Asking questions

- Listening - Gather information (see Section 7.3.1.4)

- Summarizing - Performed regularly on coherent parts of information

- Checking - Deepen the level of understanding between the interviewer and the interviewee by asking new questions based on the summary made so far

- Closing - Explain next steps

Interviewing skills are essential for obtaining information and performing successful assessments. Good interview style is practiced by:

- Asking open-ended questions which do not invite a “yes/no” answer

- Not reading out a questionnaire word for word

- Conducting a discussion in which the interviewer uses interpersonal skills (such as those mentioned in this section) to guide the conversation through the points to be covered

Interactions between interviewer and interviewee are often complex and, without the necessary skills, can result in misunderstandings, the withholding of information or even the capture of incorrect or false information. Interviewers do not need to be psychologists, but they do need good interpersonal skills which come from an appreciation of concepts such as:

- Emotional intelligence [Mayer 04]

- Transactional analysis [Wagner 91]

- Codependent behavior [Copeland Paper 01]

## **7.3.1.1 Emotional Intelligence**

Emotional intelligence (EI) can “help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment” [Mayer 04]. The ability-based model proposed by Salovey & Mayer proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature. For test process improvers this ability may be important when performing interviews because factual information is often just one aspect of the information being communicated.

The model proposes that EI includes four types of abilities:

- Perceiving emotions - The ability to detect and interpret emotions in an interviewee‟s face and voice and also to identify one‟s own emotions

Page 53 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

- Using emotions - The ability to harness emotions to enable thinking and analysis of problems. The emotionally intelligent test process improver can capitalize on changes of mood during an interview in order to obtain specific information or views from the interviewee.

- Understanding emotions - The ability to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions and how they might develop over time

- Managing emotions - The ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. The emotionally intelligent test process improver can manage emotions to achieve the objectives of the interview.

Measurement of EI using the ability-based model is possible, but this is not a skill which test process improvers are expected to have.

## **7.3.1.2 Transactional Analysis**

The idea of transactional analysis within an organization or business context as described by [Wagner 91] is that each person is made up of six “inner people”. These are divided into three which are classified as “effective” and three which are “ineffective”.

Communication with “effective inner people” is generally considered positive and constructive.

- The Natural Child acts spontaneously, expresses feelings, and has need for recognition, structure and stimulation

- The Adult is logical and reasonable; it deals in facts rather than feelings

- The Nurturing Parent is firm with others, but also understanding, sensitive and caring

Communication with “ineffective inner people” is generally considered to be unhelpful for obtaining information.

- The Critical Parent uses body language, gesture and tone of voice to “tell others off” perhaps by sarcasm, pointing the finger, or raised voice

- The Rebellious Child gets angry and stays angry, is very negative, does not listen, may deliberately forget things or procrastinate

- The Compliant Child blames itself, uses a soft voice, whines, is very careful and self protective

Test process improvers with an understanding of transactional analysis should be able to improve their own interviewing skills and also to be able to distinguish informative from suspect information given by interviewees, suggesting rewording of questions or (in more extreme examples) revision of the interview approach.

## **7.3.1.3 Codependent Behavior**

The term “codependency” describes an undesirable pattern of human interaction in which one person‟s shortcomings or weaknesses are compensated for by another person. In the words of Lee Copeland [Copeland Paper 01] “We do all the wrong things for all the right reasons.” We have an unhealthy focus on the needs of others and may even start to assume the responsibility or “cover up” for the behavior of others.

An appreciation of codependency is important in the improvement of testing processes because these unhealthy codependent interactions can mask the true reasons for particular problems or could even be the problem themselves.

Lee Copeland provides some typical examples of codependency in the area of software development:

- Developers agree to implement systems without having a clear understanding of user needs

- If testers are given absurd schedules for their work by management they “do their best” by testing as much as possible in the time available

In these examples a pattern exists of inappropriate behaviors (by development and management) and codependent responses. The short-term effect of these responses may be beneficial, but the longterm consequences may be damaging because the wrong messages are being sent out; “we don‟t care about users” , or “our testing estimates are always inflated”.

Page 54 of 75

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

Test process improvers should be aware of some typical indicators of codependence when conducting interviews:

- Responses which include “I do my best” (even though I know this is wrong)

- Responses which include “Never mind” (this needs correction, but I‟ll pretend it‟s OK)

- Denial of risk (this could result in disaster, but I could suffer if I mention it)

- Responses where the interviewee tries to convince the interviewer that clearly incorrect behaviors are in some way “normal”

In the long term, codependent persons may become the victims, feeling angry that they are constantly having to accept situations they know are wrong. A sense of resignation may set in as they begin tolerating abnormal, unhealthy, and inappropriate behaviors.

Test process improvers should appreciate that software testing professionals, of course, want to be helpful. At the same time they should carefully compare the short-term benefits of codependent behavior with the long-term difficulties that may arise. Improvement suggestions may need to focus on the long-term issues and on helping the codependent person out of their situation.

## _7.3.2 Listening Skills_

Listening skills are useful for extracting the information from what is being said and for preparing possible replies. “Active listening” is a technique which focuses on the person being spoken to and provides a structured approach for listening and responding to them. [Atwater 81]

## _7.3.3 Presentation and Reporting Skills_

Presentation and reporting skills are important for:

- Obtaining “buy-in“ to test process improvement

- Clearly showing results to stakeholders

- Suggesting specific improvements

Skills in presenting management summaries help to focus on key points at the right level of abstraction and without too many non-essential details. Effective application of these skills requires the presenter to:

- Be selective and choose only a few key ideas

- Be specific about how your ideas will work in your (or your customer‟s) context

- Be realistic with timescales for improvements

- Talk the language of the managers

- Anticipate questions

Test process improvers are aware of their audience when presenting and reporting information. The views of quality presented in Section 2.3 provide guidance on the type and depth of information presented. For example, management sponsors typically take a “value” view of quality and should therefore be presented with high-level information (e.g., improvement suggestions) which impacts their business.

Specific presentation and/or reporting skills (see [Few 08]),[Tufte 90] and [Tufte 97]) include:

- Information design

- The ability to select appropriate media for the audience

- Understanding of the appropriate use of evidence from metrics and statistics

- Understanding of the proper use of diagrams, charts and graphics

- Speaking effectively in public

- Eliciting feedback from the audience being aware of audience response

## _7.3.4 Analytical Skills_

Chapter 4 describes a number of techniques relating to analytical improvement approaches. The general analysis skills required to apply these techniques are summarized below:

- Ability to summarize gathered information

- Ability to identify trends and patterns in information

- Ability to transform information into other formats e.g., text to process flow diagram, Mind-Map to presentation, etc.

- Knowledge of when statistical analysis is appropriate and when not (see [Huff 93])

- Understanding and differentiating between: (1) cause and effect, (2) correlation and (3) coincidence when analyzing and reporting data

- Understanding of the application and analysis of statistical information

## _7.3.5 Note-taking Skills_

These skills permit the effective capture of relevant information. This may be particularly important, for example, when conducting interviews.

Mind-Maps [Buzan 95] are a natural and easily acquired technique for preparing and controlling interviews, establishing connections between individual topics and for note-taking. They use principles of association between visual elements (“doodles“) and text to provide the following benefits:

- The “big picture” can be captured effectively

- Note taking is quicker and better organized

- Presentation is easier to summarize

- The association of content to your ideas is easier to make

- It is easier to recall main points

Note that using Mind-Maps should remain the personal choice of the interviewer. Some interviewers may be inhibited during the interview by the need for premature analysis when constructing MindMaps. Alternatives include:

- Using natural text to preserve the actual interview responses

- Using short-hand forms of text such as key words

- Using diagrams and flowcharts

When note-taking the use of a laptop is sometimes considered a barrier between interviewer and interviewee which may even defeat the objective of the listening and interviewing skills. The decision to take notes electronically should therefore be made with care and in agreement with the interviewee.

Some interviewers record their interviewees by audio or video, and transcribe. This can be useful, but must only be done with the permission of the interviewee, and with agreement about how the recorded information may be used, and when / how the recording will be destroyed if necessary. Interviewees may not talk freely when the interview is recorded, even though have given permission for this approach.

In some situations, such as group workshops, it may be better to collect and display the notes openly using, for example, flip charts, sticky notes or marked cards. When everyone in the room can see the notes and can contribute to them it is easier to reach agreement and obtain buy-in on the notes taken.

## _7.3.6 Skills of Persuasion_

These skills are important to the test process improver where key stakeholders may need to be convinced of a particular improvement and when a future vision needs to be established. This may be the case, for example, where there is some initial resistance to change or where the person simply has limited time in which to understand issues and make decisions.

Page 56 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

A useful technique which may be applied is described in [Frank 90]. This simple technique consists of the following steps:

- Set objectives

- Select audience (unless this is obvious)

- Choose an approach

- Use a hook to get attention

- Know the subject

- Ask for the objective (or a next step towards achieving it)

Persuasion techniques are also part of sales and marketing techniques, as described by [Cialdini] and warned against by [Burnstein 03].

## _7.3.7 Management Skills_

For test process improvers a wide range of management skills are relevant to specific test improvement tasks but details of these are beyond the scope of this syllabus. The skills include, for example,

- Planning

- Estimating

- Decision-making

- Risk management

## 8.1 Introduction

Process improvement will not be successful without change management; the bulk of the investment in improvement is typically in deployment. In this chapter the process of managing change is presented as a series of steps and activities.

## 8.2 Fundamental Change Management Process

The changes required for a process improvement will almost certainly fail unless they are performed in the context of a change management process. The eight step process for change described in [Kotter & Rathgeber 05] can be applied to any IT-discipline, including test process improvement.

## **Set the stage**

Step 1. Create a sense of urgency

- Establish the need for improvement (see Section 6.2.1) preferably expressed by objective measurements and supported by a statement of risk (i.e. the risk of not implementing the proposed changes)

- Make it clear what changes will occur in what sequence and give broad timescales Obtain visible management support and resources

- Step 2. Pull together the guiding team (e.g., Test Process Group, Section 7.1.1)

- Engage natural early adopters as champions of change

- Establish these people in the role of “multiplier” (i.e. a first level support person who passes on knowledge to others and motivates them)

## **Decide what to do**

Step 3. Develop the change vision and strategy

- Manage expectations (clear objectives, what is in scope and what is not - “we are not changing the world”)

- Establish a strategy (see Section 6.2.2)

Page 58 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

## **Make it happen**

Step 4. Communicate for understanding and buy-in

- Provide information (presentations, road-shows, newsletters, etc.) relating to:

- How measures that are being taken align with the goals set for the organization (strategy, policy, challenge, etc.)

- How the measure will benefit employees and help them to improve their work

- Previous successes and failures, indicating what will be different this time

- Prototype ideas (initially a bottom-up improvement strategy using a low-risk project may be supportive of prototyping)

- Motivate all those affected by the change (See [Maslow] for further details of the ”Hierarchy of Needs”)

## Step 5. Empower others to act

- Provide management support to enable change to take place (e.g., to help remove obstacles to change)

- Provide a feedback mechanism for those affected by the change. This may need to be anonymous depending on cultural issues.

## Step 6. Produce short-term wins

- Go for quick wins – publish and reward them – gain momentum and motivate

- Prioritize any quick wins that can reasonably be expected to stay in place and won‟t need to be undone in the near future in deference to broader considerations

## Step 7. Don‟t let up

- Ensure that top-down improvement strategies are supported by a separate improvement team (e.g., the Test Process Group, Section 7.1.1), which owns the improvement process and ensures that agreed changes are implemented according to the improvement plan

## **Make it stick**

Step 8. Create a new culture

- Roll-out gradually using incremental steps and, where possible, avoid “big-bang” changes

- Determine whether the introduced changes have resulted in improvement. Consider each success as an opportunity to build on what went right and identify what can be improved further.

- Publicize the achievement of objectives (“do good things and talk about them”).This can be done on the basis of quantitative metrics or using a qualitative scale (e.g., based on questions such as  "Are things getting better?").

- If any objectives have not been reached, provide analysis and evidence for the reasons and learn from them

- Ensure that management support is available if problems occur with adopting changes

- Install a culture of continuous improvement

## 8.3 Human Factors in the Change Management Process

This section addresses people‟s attitude toward change and their learning needs. An individual or team‟s reaction to change depends on their previous experience with change implementation, their attitude to change, the level of trust in the organization and the extent to which the team owns the change.

Page 59 of 75

© International Software Testing Qualifications Board

International Software Testing Qualifications Board

The change management process must allow for awareness, discussion, and differences in attitude to change when planning the improvement implementation.

Valuable information on the human aspects involved in change are described in [Karten 09] and [Kübler-Ross 07].

The material covered in [Karten 09] refers to the Satir model [Satir 91] and deals with the human aspects of change with particular regard to IT projects. The Satir model describes the impact of change on an individual or group‟s performance or productivity and consists of the following components of change:

- Old status quo - the current “normal” state

- Introduction of a disrupting event (“foreign element”)

- Chaos - the reaction to the disrupting event

- Transforming ideas - the way out of the chaos

- Practice and integration - the adjustment to the change

- New status quo - the new “normal” state

The Elizabeth Kübler-Ross model [Kübler-Ross 07] examines stages of grief around bereavement and expected bereavement, and this has been used in business change as a metaphor for how people sometimes handle change to working practices. More recently, [Adams et al] added further stages (marked in the list with *). The stages are:

- Relief * - “at least I now know what‟s happening”

- Shock and/or surprise* - a sense of disbelief

- Denial - total non-acceptance of the change and maybe proving to oneself that it is not happening and hoping that it will go away

- Anger - experiencing anger and frustration

- Bargaining - in an attempt to avoid the inevitable

- Depression - hitting the lows and responding with apathy or sadness

- Acceptance - reality of the situation is accepted

- Experimentation* - after having been very inward looking with acceptance, the idea arrives that perhaps there are things „out there‟

- Discovery* - the discovery that things may not be as bad as first imagined

Note that although both the Satir model and the Kübler-Ross model describe stages in the change process, they are not stages in a linear process. People confronted by change do not necessarily pass through all these stages in this order. They may also repeat stages or even miss some stages. The “stages” are simply a description of emotional responses to change.

[Honey&Mumford 02], [Kirton web], and [Myers&Briggs 95] provide information about:

- Types of individual (e.g., Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)

- The motivation for an individual for change and improvement

- Whether change will be welcome or resisted

- Whether teams will be early or late adopters of improvement

- Whether they will be prepared to experiment and accept some failure in the changes or whether they will not be prepared to change until a “perfect” solution is provided

- The different learning styles that individuals prefer and hence acceptable/engaging ways to present the proposed changes [Honey & Mumford]

- An individual‟s preference for change by adaptation of existing methods or by innovation of new methods [Kirton Web]

## 9.1 Key Success Factors

In Chapter 8 the process of change management was described and identified as a key success factor in introducing test process improvement. In this chapter a number of additional factors are discussed in two distinct sets.

## **“Getting started”**

The first set of success factors is primarily related to the initial phases of an improvement project and can be linked to the “Initiating” and “Diagnosing” phases from the IDEAL improvement framework (Section 2.4.2).  These success factors are:

- Clear, measurable and realistic objectives for the improvement process are set

- Management commitment and sponsorship available

- Test improvement organized as a formal project

- People involved have sufficient time scheduled for participation

- Ambitions mapped to the maturity of the (development) organization

- Change management process established (see Chapter 8)

## **“Getting the job done”**

The second set of success factors is related to the implementation phases of an improvement project. These factors are:

- Clear time scales for improvements and length of feedback cycles are defined. These are not too large so that momentum can be maintained.

- Clear, measurable and realistic improvement targets for every cycle

- Process ownership identified and organized

- Control and monitoring of all steps in the change management process (see Chapter 8)

- Test professionals involved when defining and implementing the improvements

- Other stakeholders involved where problems lie outside the testing discipline, e.g., quality of specifications, change and release management processes

- Resistance managed; marketing performed, e.g., level of resistance will depend on the success or failure of previous improvement efforts

- Existing practices used if already available; don‟t change for the sake of changing. If something which is available is not being used then first investigate the reasons why

- Stable project team organized that works well together and buys into the change/vision

- Tools to support and/or enable test improvements considered (see Section 2.5.4.2)

- Available knowledge and skills of people involved considered. This covers not just testing in general but also areas related to the improvement process and skills for the improvement approach(es) to be used (e.g., specific model, analysis techniques)

- Human factors such as learning styles, personality types and attitudes considered

- External consultants involved as needed, e.g., for specific knowledge and skills, but do not let them take full responsibility for the improvement project

- Awareness of external standards, which may be mandatory, e.g., FDA for the medical industry

- Overall process and terminology defined up front to ensure that the various components of the improvement strategy are aligned and part of an overall framework

- Relationships built with all affected stakeholders, e.g., software process improvement officers, quality assurance and human resources department

- Progress clearly demonstrated

- Internal approval and/or regulatory processes obeyed

- Alignment with other improvement initiatives ensured

- Maturity levels of development and testing remain broadly in step to avoid potential process inconsistencies

## 9.2 Setting a Culture for Improvement

Improvement needs to be set within the cultural context of the organization, for example:

- The management culture (command and control, consultative, team-driven) will influence the acceptability of the approach suggested

- The geographical location of the organization (e.g., some models and improvement approaches are better accepted in the U.S.; some are more accepted in Asia)

- The goals, policies and strategy, and attitude toward improvement (e.g., whether an improvement approach is already in use elsewhere in the organization and if that has been successful)

- Relationships between departments, e.g., if two companies merge, then there may be resistance to changing to improved procedures if these are perceived as coming from the “other” organization

- The life cycle model being used (sequential, iterative, agile,” home grown” or no process) will influence the frequency of process changes which are acceptable to projects

- The test approach being used (automated, manual, scripted, exploratory, mixed approach, ad hoc) will influence the acceptability of the type of change being suggested

An example of an approach is the Test Process Improvement manifesto [van Veenendaal Paper 08] which models the Agile Manifesto and suggests that we should consider the following points:

**Flexibility over Detailed Processes** suggests that organizations will have to engage with change, and respond to those changes with a range of risk profiles. The need for flexibility also acknowledges that testers are knowledge workers and that they should be thinking, adapting and applying processes depending on the specific context for a project. Flexibility and freedom in process shows trust in people and will motivate those people to improve.

**Best Practices over Templates** says that templates are useful but examples are even better as they show how to use the templates. Best practice examples need not be an absolute standard for the industry – they are simply what is best in the specific circumstance so one would expect several contrasted examples to choose from.

**Deployment Orientation over Process Orientation.** Building processes is easy, the challenge in improvement is deploying processes so that they are used. Process improvement is all about change management; the bulk of the investment in improvement will be in deployment.

**Reviews over Quality Assurance (departments)** says that communication and providing feedback are essential to project success. It is exactly what peer reviews do, if applied well. QA reviewers may be too far from the test team to give timely and valued feedback. Feedback loops are most effective when they are local and fast.

**Business-driven over Model-driven** reminds us that the improvement is to benefit the business not just to provide conformance to an external standard.

This approach to improvement would be acceptable in an organization sympathetic to team-driven approaches, agile software development and exploratory testing. It may be harder to “sell” in an organization with a command and control management style, strong reliance on detailed processes, and scripted tests.

## _Learning objectives for adapting to different life cycle models_

## **10.1 Adapting to Different Life Cycle Models**

- LO 10.1.1 (K2) Understand the factors that influence the way improvement is organized and that this is always context dependent

- LO 10.1.2 (K2) Summarize the test improvement approach in agile environments

- LO 10.1.3 (K2) Summarize the test improvement approach in iterative environments

- LO 10.1.4 (K2) Give examples of where test process improvement models need to be adapted to be suitable for agile and/or iterative life-cycles

## 10.1 Adapting to Different Life Cycle Models

The improvement methods described earlier in the syllabus are not specific to any particular lifecycle methodology. However, improvement always needs to be set in a particular context, for example:

- The management culturein the organization (command and control, consultative, team driven) will influence the acceptability of the approach suggested.

- The life cycle model being used (sequential, iterative, agile, "home grown” or no process) will influence the frequency cycle for changes in process to be acceptable to projects

- The test approach being used (automated, manual, scripted, exploratory, mixed approach, ad hoc) will influence the acceptability of the type of change being suggested.

For example, adoption of an agile software development life cycle means:

- Emphasis on self-managing teams, who can change their own processes as needed

- The relationship to lean approaches needs to be considered, particularly at an organizational level

These factors may bias the choice of improvement methods to those favored in .lean management, for example short Deming cycles and the use of cause-effect diagrams. This does not mean that these techniques cannot be used in other life cycle models, nor does it mean that model-based approaches cannot be applied to organizations or projects using agile life cycles. The choice of life cycle should not dictate the choice of improvement method.

Any software process model or test process model can be used as a reference point on how to actually improve what has been judged as important to improve. In agile or iterative contexts, many alternative ideas lead to different improvement paths compared to the traditional life cycle models, which principally have sequential emphasis.

In an iterative context you might use ideas from RUP (Rational Unified Process) or in an agile environment you might use ideas from SCRUM, such as retrospective meetings at the end of each sprint to provide very fast feedback loops and the opportunity to perform process improvement every few days. In an agile context many improvement paths of the content-based models with sequential emphasis have to be tailored extensively. Agile testing, in the context defined in SCRUM or Extreme Programming and other related developing testing practices, can also provide testing structure more suitable to agile processes.

Sequential models such as the V-model have feedback loops for checking product and process conformance and suitability (verification and validation) at all phase ends. From these phase-end

reviews suggested improvements to the test process (static and dynamic testing) may be made by using any of the methods described in this chapter.

If a particular maturity target has been chosen, for example if a CMMi level is a target, that does not prevent the use of any particular approach to test improvements, nor does it dictate any specific life cycle model.

- Identify whether the chosen life cycle model predisposes particular improvement process choices

- Identify what is the correct fit of process improvement method for the context

- Identify the appropriate test structures and practices for the context

## **12. Appendix A – Notice to Training Providers**

## 12.1 Training Times

Each chapter in the syllabus is assigned an allocated time in minutes. The purpose of this is both to give guidance on the relative proportion of time to be allocated to each section of an accredited course, and to give an approximate minimum time for the teaching of each section.

Training providers may spend more time than is indicated and candidates may spend more time again in reading and research. A course curriculum does not have to follow the same order as the syllabus.

It is not required to conduct the course in one continuous block of time.

The following guidelines have been used:

|**Learning Objective K-Level **|**Minutes (average)**|
|---|---|
|K2|15|
|K3|60|
|K4|75|
|K5|90|
|K6|90|

The table below provides a guideline for teaching and exercise times for each chapter and shows separately the timing for exercises which may be conducted in the workplace (all times are shown in minutes). Note that exercises in the workplace may also be conducted as part of the course given by the training provider (see Section 12.3.1 below).

## 12.2 Standards Used

The syllabus contains references to established standards (see Section 11.1), which must be used in the preparation of training material. Each standard used must be the version quoted in the current version of this syllabus. Other publications, templates or standards not referenced in this syllabus may also be used and referenced, but will not be examined.

## 12.3 Practical Exercises

Practical work should be included for all aspects where candidates are expected to apply their knowledge (learning objective of K3 or higher). The lectures and exercises should be based on the learning objectives and the description of the topics in the content of the syllabus.

## _12.3.1 Guidelines for Practical Exercises in the Workplace_

Certain learning objectives may be achieved by conducting practical exercises in the workplace. The following table shows the learning objectives which may be covered by these workplace exercises:

|**Subject Area**|**Relevant Learning Objectives**|

|Critical Success Factors|LO 9.1.2<br>(K5) Assess the critical success factors for a test improvement<br>project|
||LO 9.1.3<br>(K5) Recommend appropriate measures to mitigate the project risks<br>identified|

The following guidelines apply:

1. Training providers must publish any requirements for practical exercises in the workplace before the course commences.

2. The training provider must approve a proposal submitted by the participant before the practical exercise takes place.

3. The training provider must ensure that the relevant teaching has been provided before the participant performs the practical exercise.

4. Communication between the training provider and the participant must be made available for answering questions and checking on progress.

5. The results of the practical exercise must be submitted to the training provider. It is recommended that the results are presented or at least made available to other course participants.
